# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

<b>Skills used:</b> Python,Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Logistic Regression

<b>Project objctive: </b> By predicting the bike rental demand in advance from weather forecast, Bike Rental Company position the bike according to customers demands resulting in increase in bike utilization.

<b>Quantifiable Result:</b> We could predict the rentals bike count resulting in 48% **accuracy**.

   - Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
   - The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
   - Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
   - Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/anshu109/logistic-project/blob/master/logistic_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/bank.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skilled Used**- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn

**Project objective**: In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit or not  

**Quantifiable result**: We could predict 90.6% **Accuracy** in UCI BANK Data

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/anshu109/knn_naive_project/blob/master/knn_naive_bias_project.ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skilled Used**- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn
**Project Objective**: The classification goal is to predict of orthopedic parameters and provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal.

**Quantifiable Result**: We could predict the orthopedic patient is Normal or Abnormal Accuracy of the Naive Bayes Clasification is 82.26% .

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patientâ€™s condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
